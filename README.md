# max4805.github.io

This is a stripped down version of [the Vue.js app included in max480-random-stuff.appspot.com](https://github.com/max4805/RandomStuffWebsite/tree/main/front-vue), containing only [the Banana Mirror Browser](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/banana-mirror-browser).

This was made because github.io is accessible from China, and appspot.com isn't. This website will eventually use dedicated APIs accessible from there as well. :sweat_smile:
